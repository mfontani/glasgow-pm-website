    <h2>Topics for this technical meeting</h2>
    <div>
        Murray Walker (<a href="http://twitter.com/mintywalker">@mintywalker</a>) will talk about minimising HTML on his personal homepage,
        whilst keeping the HTML markup used valid.
        Marco Fontani (<a href="http://twitter.com/mfontani">@mfontani</a>) will bring a talk about Dancer, the Perl web framework.
        Aaron Crane (<a href="http://twitter.com/aaroncrane">@aaroncrane</a>) will bring a talk about monkey patching.
        Others have volunteered to bring talks but are not sure yet.

        There will be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk">lightning talks</a>
        session right after the talks, and the group will then likely go to a pub
        for the &quot;local meeting&quot; of Drinkers.pm (the social event).
