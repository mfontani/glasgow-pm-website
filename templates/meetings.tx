      <h3>Where do technical meetings take place?</h3>
      <div class="article">
          The group has been given access to a room/projector at
          <a href="http://www.s1thecompany.com/">S1</a>'s offices in Glasgow,
          located at 200 Renfield street (<a href="http://bit.ly/bTFAFK">Google maps link</a>).

      <h3>What kind of meetings should I expect?</h3>
      <div class="article">
        The aim is to have predominantly technical meetings, with the odd social meeting once in a while.
        The timing of the meetings does also allow members from nearby Perl Mongers group to participate.<br />
        If you're interested, please join the discussion on the
        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/glasgowpm">mailing list</a> to voice your opinion.

      <h3>Where are the meetings slides?</h3>
      <div class="article">
        Each meeting's page usually contains links to the websites of the people
        who submitted and held a talk. Sometimes the author also provides a link to
        the talk, in which case the meetings pages are amended to contain such links.
